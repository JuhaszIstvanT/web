        Hi, I'm Gayle Laakmann McDowell, author of Cracking the Coding Interview. Today
    00:03
    we're going to talk about linked lists. A linked list is a very simple data structure.
    00:08
    It's essentially just a sequence of elements, where each element links to the next
    00:12
    element which links the next element. A linked list can contain pretty much any
    00:16
    type of data, strings, characters, numbers, the elements can be unsorted or sorted,
    00:22
    they can contain duplicate elements or all unique elements. One of the things
    00:27
    that distinguishes a linked list from an array which shares many of the same
    00:30
    properties is that in the array elements are indexed. That is, if you want to get
    00:36
    to the fourth element you can just, boom, instantly do that. In a linked list
    00:41
    though you have to start with the head and work your way through until you get
    00:46
    to the fourth element, That takes linear time so it's quite a bit slower. So why
    00:51
    would anyone use such a data structure? Well the advantage of a linked list is
    00:56
    that insertions and deletions can be very quick. If you just want to insert an
    01:01
    element right to the beginning of the linked list, that can be done in constant
    01:05
    time. If you want to delete an element from the beginning of the linked list again
    01:10
    constant time. So that's very very fast.
    01:14
    Of course if you want to append an element to the end of the linked list
    01:17
    that might require walking all the way through the linked list until you get
    01:22
    the very last element and then inserting the element there. That will take linear
    01:27
    time so it all depends really on what you're looking for.
    01:30
    Now there's one other thing we should talk about before we dive into the code,
    01:34
    and that is this alternate version called a doubly linked list. A doubly
    01:39
    linked list is just like a singly linked list but in addition to each element
    01:43
    having a link to the next element, each element also links the previous element.
    01:48
    For certain operations that can be quite handy. Now that we've covered the basics
    01:54
    of a linked list let's take a look at what the code would look like. Implementing
    01:58
    a linked list is reasonably straightforward.
    02:00
    We just need a class node that takes in, has a next value, and a data, and then
    02:08
    just to make our lives easier we'll add in a constructor.
    02:11
    And set that value. Ok. So the first method we'll want to implement is an
    02:18
    append method. So let's go ahead and get started with that. Append is going to
    02:22
    take in a data value and then it's going to have some pointer that starts off
    02:30
    at the current node so the head of the linked list and then it's going
    02:34
    to walk through the linked list until we get to the end of the linked list.
    02:38
    Well how do we know that we're not at the end of the linked list?
    02:42
    Well we're not at the end of the linked list as long as there's something after
    02:45
    it.
    02:46
    So in other words while current dot next does not equal null, keep moving, get to the
    02:52
    end of the linked list. Then when we get down to the end of the linked list,
    02:55
    create this new node. If we prepend an element we're going to actually change
    03:02
    what the head node is. Now this makes a little bit of an issue because we could
    03:08
    have multiple places our code base that all link to the same head. But if we
    03:12
    change the head in one place
    03:15
    how does everybody else know that our head value changed? So the workaround for
    03:20
    this is rather than giving everybody an access to the head pointer directly, we
    03:26
    define a class linked list that's basically going to wrap our head. And
    03:33
    then the append method can go where it probably should have from the
    03:37
    beginning, which is in this linked list class. Let's just update this because the
    03:41
    current node should actually point to the head. And what's nice here is that we
    03:46
    can also add in the case if the head is null, so we can say if the head is null then
    03:53
    actually we just want to create the head. So if head is null, head equals new node data
    04:00
    and then
    04:04
    we can just return because now we're done with that.
    04:07
    Alright. Prepending is relatively easy now. We just need to, so its going to avoid
    04:15
    again, prepend taken data. Now the way this method will work is that we're
    04:22
    going to create actually a new head value. So node new head equals new node
    04:29
    data. Then new head's next value is going to link over to the old head and then we
    04:37
    need to change the head pointer. For our final operation let's implement a method
    04:43
    delete that deletes the first node that has a particular value. So first we'll just
    04:49
    declare our method. Void delete with value that takes in a data.
    04:57
    Ok now if head is null, we know we just want to return immediately.
    05:04
    There's nothing we can do there. Now what delete with value is going to do is its
    05:08
    going to walk through the linked list and it's going to stop one
    05:12
    before the element we want to delete. And then its going to say, uh oh, the very next
    05:17
    element you want to delete? So I'm going to actually just update my pointers to
    05:21
    work around it so my next pointer is going to be that deleted values next
    05:26
    pointer. So let's see how this works.
    05:29
    So first we'll have this little current method that walks through the linked list.
    05:34
    And then we're going to walk through as long as we're not at the last element so
    05:40
    we don't want to run off the edge of the linked list.
    05:42
    Ok now if current dot next dot data equals the data were trying to lead.
    05:50
    So in other words if the next value is the one you want to delete, then cut out that
    05:55
    next value. So then current dot next equals current dot next dot next. And then we
    06:02
    return.
    06:03
    So what this is doing is saying, okay, if the next value you want to delete, don't go
    06:08
    to the element, and just walk around it. Set my next pointer to be my next
    06:12
    pointer's next pointer so walk around it. And then
    06:16
    in other cases we just move on to the next element. Now there's one case we
    06:21
    want to be very careful of here which is what happens if the node we want to delete is
    06:25
    actually the head node? This will actually cause a problem in our current
    06:29
    scenario because we need to actually update the head value. So we can just
    06:35
    special case that. If head dot data is the data we want to delete then head equals
    06:43
    head dot next. That is just cut me out of the linked list. Now let's take a look at
    06:49
    what our method does. So first it takes in this data and then says okay if head is
    06:54
    null, return,
    06:56
    there's nothing we can do. If we need to delete the head then just go and delete
    07:00
    it. Set head equal to head dot next, set equal to the next value. Otherwise walk through
    07:05
    the linked list starting at the head value, then, as long as, walk up until
    07:10
    the next value is the one we want to delete, in which case we say, okay, set current dot next, my
    07:18
    next pointer, over to the next next value. And then we return.
    07:21
    Otherwise we continue walking through the linked list. So those are the basic
    07:27
    operations for deleting, inserting both appending and prepending into a linked
    07:32
    list. Now that you've seen the basic operations why don't you give it a shot on a
    07:36
    new linked list problem.
